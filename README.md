# React-Style cloud Infrastructure as code with Pulumi TypeScript"

Imagine deploying your AWS infrastructure as effortlessly as you build React components. With our Pulumi TypeScript project, you can do just that. Structured similarly to a React application, our project includes a components directory with modules like VPC, ALB, and EC2, all orchestrated through an index.ts file for seamless deployment via GitHub. This approach makes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) not only accessible but also production-ready for React developers, offering a familiar pattern for managing complex cloud environments.
